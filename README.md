DGS Vaccination Management System

This project develops a software application for Portugal’s state-funded healthcare system (DGS) to manage the Covid-19 vaccination process. 
The system allows SNS users to schedule vaccinations, receive notifications, and obtain vaccination certificates. 
It supports management of vaccination centers, employees (nurses, receptionists, coordinators), and vaccine administration details, including multiple doses, age groups, and vaccine types.

The system also enables center coordinators to monitor operations, generate reports, and analyze performance using statistical tools, 
including identifying periods of low vaccination efficiency via a maximum contiguous subsequence algorithm. Administrators manage the core system data, ensuring smooth daily operation.

Designed to be flexible, the application can handle future pandemics and may be commercialized for other organizations or healthcare systems.
